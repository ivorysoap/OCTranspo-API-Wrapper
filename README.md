# OC Transpo API Wrapper :busstop: :oncoming_bus:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ivorysoap/PiMonth2019-PiOT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ivorysoap/PiMonth2019-PiOT)

:warning: **Under construction** â€” Much like the O-Train Confederation 
Line itself, this is a constant work in progress and there's no saying 
for sure when it'll be done.

## Overview

This is a wrapper for the OC Transpo API with some built-in features.

Originally, the goal ofthis project was to make a wrapper that  provides the user more readability and ease of use than interfacing with the API directly.  However, since the API's been updated, I'm working on some new goals, like creating a Bash command to make the API accessible from a terminal.

The `oc.py` script can be used to interface with the OC Transpo API.  You give it a stop number, and it will give you either a summary of the upcoming trips for that stop, or just 
the formatted JSON that the API spits out when you give it a stop number (useful for debugging purposes).


## Usage

`$ python3 oc.py (app_id) (api_key) [-json]`

where:

* `(app_id)` is your Application ID
* `(api_key)` is your API key
* `-json` is an optional parameter - if you include it, you'll _just_ get the API's JSON output.  Otherwise, you get the regular bus stop summary.

## Dependencies

You should be able to run `oc.py` by itself as long as you have the 
following

* Python 3.7 and packages imported by `oc.py`
* OC Transpo API credentials (you'll need to get these yourself)
